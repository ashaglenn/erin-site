          Change from within is an effective and practical therapy.  Erin is professional and yet down to earth. She was able to help me
          explore different areas of insecurity that needed improvement in my life.  With her i was able to get to the root of those areas.
          As a result I've seen so many changes in myself and my thinking.  My friends and family have noticed them as well.
          A great company with proven results.

          "It really helped me dig deeper into my life long insecurity. It felt nice to be able to share these feelings, I dont even share with anyone else.
          I dont even think i like thinking about these things, but ive never went that deep and thought about the past like that.
          Your techniques that youve taught me have also really helped me take control of my emotions. Whenever a negative thought creeps up,
          I really try my best to utilize the thuings youve taught me.  I still have bad days, but i have noticed a difference in myself lately
          and its now easier to shift my mind from thinking negatively to positive thougths"

          Here are some words about my experience: The sessions with eutaptics gave time and room to bring up burdensome and psychosomatic
          challenges that often lay neglected but still present in a busy and superficial rush of day.After a few sessions with eutaptics
          painful experiences and memories from the past more thoroughly has been alleviated, leaving a sense of refreshment and peace of mind afterwards.
          This has given room for better focus - and more energy for the present, and strengthens the capacity to move forward.Erin is dedicated to her work
          and serves with respect and sensitivity with regard to the areas and topics that are being dealt with.
